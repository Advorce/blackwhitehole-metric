# Black-to-White Hole Metric (Advorce)

This project presents a custom-constructed, regular black hole metric designed to avoid the central singularity of classical Schwarzschild geometry. The metric was developed through iterative exploration by the author and ChatGPT in early 2025.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Metric Definition

This spacetime metric is defined as:

```
ds¬≤ = -[1 + (2GM)/(c¬≤ r¬≤) - (r_min/r) * exp(-r_min/r)] * c¬≤ dt¬≤
+ [1 + (2GM)/(c¬≤ r¬≤) - (r_min/r) * exp(-r_min/r)]‚Åª¬π dr¬≤
+ r¬≤ (dŒ∏¬≤ + sin¬≤Œ∏ dœÜ¬≤)
```

Where:
- \( G \): gravitational constant  
- \( M \): mass of the central object  
- \( c \): speed of light  
- \( r \): radial coordinate  
- \( r_{\min} \): minimum radius (bounce point)  
- \( f(r) = \exp(-r_{\min} / r) \): regularizing function

This form preserves the classical behavior of gravity at large \( r \) and avoids divergence at the core through a smooth, exponential damping term [1][2].

## ‚úÖ Novel Features

- **Nonsingular core**: The metric remains finite as `r ‚Üí 0`, avoiding curvature divergence [2][4].
- **Geodesic completeness**: Particles can pass through `r_min`, experiencing a bounce [2][7].
- **Asymptotic Schwarzschild**: The metric reduces to Schwarzschild at large `r` [4].
- **Independent creation**: This functional form does not match known regular metrics like Bardeen [8] or Hayward [6] and was developed independently by the author.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Not derived from Einstein's field equations ‚Äî the source stress-energy tensor is unknown [1][3].
- Energy conditions are likely violated near the core [2][3][5].
- Stability not yet analyzed (inner horizon instability is an open question) [5].

## üåå Physical Interpretation

To eliminate the singularity at the black hole core, this model introduces a damping term that modifies the geometry at small \( r \). The result is a spacetime that allows test particles to approach a minimum radius \( r_{\min} \), undergo a smooth bounce, and re-expand ‚Äî potentially connecting to a white hole or new cosmological region [2][4][7].

This behavior implies a violation of classical energy conditions, particularly near the core:
- The Null Energy Condition (NEC) and possibly the Strong Energy Condition (SEC) are likely violated within the inner region [2][3].
- This is expected ‚Äî and even required ‚Äî in any model that avoids singularities under general relativity [1][5].

Such violations do not indicate unphysical behavior. They are consistent with many modern approaches, including:
- Regular black holes (Bardeen [8], Hayward [6])
- Planck-scale cores from quantum gravity [7]
- Bounce cosmologies in loop quantum gravity [7]
- Inflation and exotic matter models [3][5]

This model does not specify the stress-energy tensor required to support the geometry, but assumes a physically plausible form of exotic matter or effective quantum corrections that allow for this regular, traversable interior [1][2].
