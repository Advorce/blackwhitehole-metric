This document outlines the global causal structure of the spacetime defined by the black/white hole bounce metric developed in this project.

## ✅ Summary of Causal Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Geodesic completeness  | No geodesics terminate; bounce avoids singularities                         |
| Bounce                 | Occurs near \( r = r_{\min} \); finite curvature replaces central singularity |
| Apparent horizons      | Strong-field effects mimic horizons without causal disconnection            |
| Asymptotic flatness    | Metric smoothly approaches flat spacetime at large \( r \)                  |
| Null structure         | Lightcones tilt correctly; no causal breakdown observed                     |

## 📐 Penrose Diagram

The compactified Penrose diagram below reveals the causal layout of the entire spacetime. This includes the bounce region, horizon-like features, and asymptotic null boundaries.

### 📊 Annotated Penrose Diagram

- **Red disk** at center: the nonsingular bounce
- **Dashed lines**: 45° null paths (lightcones)
- **Axes**: compactified null coordinates \( U = \tanh(t - r_*) \), \( V = \tanh(t + r_*) \)

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

- The **bounce** is smoothly traversable: timelike and null geodesics continue across it
- There is **no event horizon** in the classical sense — causal signals are not trapped indefinitely
- The spacetime remains **globally hyperbolic**, and **conformally complete**

## 🧠 Implications

This result supports the interpretation of this metric as a **regular black hole interior**, with a **white hole–like cosmological re-expansion** beyond the bounce. It also aligns with models of a **Big Bounce** universe — replacing the Big Bang singularity with a smooth transition.
