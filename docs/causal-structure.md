## ✅ Summary of Causal Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Geodesic completeness  | No geodesics terminate; bounce avoids singularities                         |
| Bounce                 | Occurs near \( r = r_{\min} \); finite curvature replaces classical singularity |
| Apparent horizons      | Strong-field effects mimic horizons without causal disconnection            |
| Asymptotic flatness    | Metric smoothly approaches flat spacetime at large \( r \)                  |
| Null structure         | Lightcones tilt correctly; no causal breakdown observed                     |
| Causal traversability  | Timelike and null curves pass through the bounce                            |

## 📐 Penrose Diagram

The compactified Penrose diagram below reveals the causal layout of the entire spacetime. This includes the bounce region, light-cone structure, and asymptotic null boundaries.

### 📊 Annotated Penrose Diagram

![Penrose Diagram](https://i.postimg.cc/nrZK4tfj/Screenshot-2025-05-29-160710.png)

- 🔵 **Blue disk**: nonsingular bounce region replacing the classical singularity
- 🔴 **Red diagonals**: 45° null rays crossing the bounce
- **Axes**: conformally compactified coordinates \( U \), \( V \)

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

- The **bounce** is **causally transparent**: both null and timelike geodesics pass through the core without termination.
- **No event horizon** traps information permanently — causal contact is possible across the entire geometry.
- The diagram exhibits **global hyperbolicity**: the spacetime has a Cauchy surface and deterministic causal evolution.
- The central region is **finite, regular, and symmetric** under time reversal — mimicking a smooth black-to-white hole transition.

---

## 🧠 Implications

This causal structure reinforces the physical consistency of the metric:

- ✅ **Singularity-free**: The central curvature remains finite (as shown via the Kretschmann scalar)
- ✅ **Geodesically complete**: All causal paths extend through the bounce
- ✅ **Traversable**: Matter and light are not causally disconnected
- ✅ **Quantum-compatible**: Behavior matches predictions of loop quantum gravity and other regularization models

This supports interpretation of the metric as:

- A **regular black hole interior**
- A **quantum-corrected bounce cosmology**
- A candidate model for **black-to-white hole transition** or even a **Big Bounce cosmology**
