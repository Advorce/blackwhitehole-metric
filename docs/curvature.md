# Curvature Regularity

We computed the Kretschmann scalar:

\[
K = R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
\]

### ✔️ At Bounce (r = 1)

\[
K(r = 1) \approx 104.2
\]

### ✔️ Over Full Range (0.1 ≤ r ≤ 10)

K(r) is finite throughout the entire range. There is a single smooth peak around \( r = 1 \), and the curvature falls off as \( r \to \infty \), indicating asymptotic flatness.
