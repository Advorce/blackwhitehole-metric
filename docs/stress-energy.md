# Effective Stress-Energy Tensor

We derived the stress-energy tensor via:

\[
T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{8\pi} G_{\mu\nu}
\]

### Results at r = 1

- \( T_{tt} \approx 0.229 \) → energy density ✅
- \( T_{rr} \approx -0.050 \) → radial pressure ❌
- \( T_{\theta\theta} \approx +0.046 \) → transverse pressure ✅

### Interpretation

The effective matter content is *exotic but bounded*, violating some conditions (like NEC) only mildly and locally.
